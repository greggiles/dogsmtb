# Required Equipment and Notes

We ride our bikes off road, on non-linear dirt trails. We ride all summer when it is warm or hot. We ride into the Fall when it can be much cooler. It is important for riders to be prepared for our rides.  

## Helmet

First and foremost, our riders are required to wear a helmet whenever they are on thier bike. 

::: info No Exceptions
There are no exceptions to the helmet rule. All riders MUST comply or be suspended from the team.

## Hydration

All riders are required to come prepared with water for our rides. Options include water bottles, camelbacks, or even bottled water in a backpack. 

## Eye Protection

Since we ride on trails, there can be vegitation hanging over the trail, and sometimes dust and pebbles are kicked up while riders are riding. Eye protection is **strongly** encouraged for all riders. 

Options for eye protection can vary from $2 safety glasses from the Home Depot, to $200 Oakley shades. All options are acceptable!

## Gloves

Riders should wear gloves to protect their hands in case of a tumble. Gloves also help maintain grip when riders sweat or it is rainy.

## A Mountain Bike

Bikes aren't listed first, becuase the other items are just as important! 

Bikes must be trail ready, and shouldn't have a kickstand. 

::: info Kickstand's Must be Removed
Kickstands may be convienient when storing bikes in the garage, however, they can act like a catapault if they extend accidentally while riding
:::

Being trail-ready helps our rides go smoothly, and allows for our coaches to attend to leading good rides instead of doing unnesseary trailside repairs. Trail ready means at least the following:

- Brakes Work Well
- Bike Shifts Well
- Chain and Drivetrain clean and smooth

## Tool and Supplies

Older riders should learn how to service and handle trailside repairs. Coaches can help riders identify good options, as can local shops.

- A Multi-tool
- Pump or C02
- Spare Tube
