## Practice Season

We will begin practices on May 23rd! For those new to the team, practice routes and distances vary by group. Each rider is assigned to a group of about 10-15 riders, and the group rides appropriate distance and difficulty for the group.

- Practice #1: May 23rd at Island Lake Recreation Area (ILRA)
- Practice #2: May 25th at Brighton Recreation Area (BRA)
